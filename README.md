Employee Data Analysis Project with SQL, Excel & Power BI
I recently completed a comprehensive data project. In this project, I worked with SQL, Excel, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize employee data.
The project includes:
 • Data cleaning and transformation using SQL in MySQL
 • Interactive Excel dashboard with pivot tables, calculated fields, and dynamic filtering
 • Power BI visualizations including charts, KPI cards, and slicers for deeper insights
This project is part of my continuous learning journey in data analysis, where I apply and refine skills in SQL, Excel, Power BI.
Always open to feedback and suggestions — striving to improve with every project!
